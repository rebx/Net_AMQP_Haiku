Net-AMQP-Haiku version 0.01
===========================

A Simple Perl Module using Net::AMQP. 

This module is designed to be as simple as possible -- this module
shall only require Net::AMQP and Try::Tiny to run, and be compatible from Perl
version 5.8.8 and up.

USAGE

    Module Import and Object Instantiation
    
        use Net::AMQP::Haiku;
        my $amqp = Net::AMQP::Haiku->new({
            host=> 'localhost',
            spec_file => '/path/to/spec/file/amqp'
        });
          
    Open a Channel
    
        # open default channel (set to 1)
        $amqp->open_channel();
        
        # open a specific channel
        my $channel_id = 72;
        $amqp->open_channel($channel_id);
        
    Set the Queue
    
        # basic example for a queue named foo
        $amqp->set_queue('foo');
        
        # full options
        $amqp->set_queue($queue_name, { auto_delete => 1,
                                        no_ack => 0,
                                        nowait => 0,
                                        durable => 1,
                                        passive => 0,
                                        ticket => 0,
                                        exclusive => 0 });
        
    Basic Publish
    
        # send a message using defaults
        $amqp->send("ohai!");
        
        # send a message using all available options
        $amqp->send("ohai!", $queue_name, { routing_key => $routing_key,
                                            channel=> $channel,
                                            reply_to => $reply_to,
                                            correlation_id => $correlation_id });
        
    Basic Message Retrieval
    
        # basic example after open_channel() and set_queue()
        # receive() and get() are synonymous
        print $amqp->receive();
        $msg = $amqp->receive();
        $msg = $amqp->get();
        
        # full options
        $msg = $amqp->get($queue_name, {no_ack => 0});
        
    Basic Producer
        
        # basic example after open_channel() and set_queue()
        $amqp->send("test message");
        
    Basic Consumer
        
        # basic consumer after open_channel() and set_queue()
        $amqp->nom( { queue => $queue_name} );
        # stop consuming
        $amqp->halt_consumption();
        # or
        $amqp->halt_consumption($consumer_tag);
        
        
    Purge a Queue
        
        $amqp->purge_queue($queue_name);
        
    Delete a Queue
    
        $amqp->delete_queue($queue_name);
